It is located on the 100 feet (30 m) inner-ring road (Jawaharlal Nehru Road) in Koyambedu between SAF Games Village and the Koyambedu Vegetable Market. It is the largest bus terminus in India as well as Asia.[2][3] Chennai Metro Rail operates a coach depot behind the bus terminus since 2015.The bus terminus originally functioned at the Broadway terminus near Madras High Court in George Town, in an area covering about 1.5 acres (6,100 m2).With the growing population and transportation demand, a new terminus was planned at Koyambedu.
